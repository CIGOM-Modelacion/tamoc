Here, we describe several terms used in the Texas A&M Oil spill / Outfall
Calculator ``TAMOC`` package. For terms related to the Python programming
language, please see http://python.org/ or https://www.enthought.com/. For
information on the numerical Python packages NumPy and SciPy, please see
http://www.numpy.org/ and http://www.scipy.org/.

Terms
=====

* *Ambient* -- Refers to the fluid surrounding a bubble, drop, or plume.  
  For the ``TAMOC`` package, this is usually seawater, but it could also be
  freshwater.  Properties of the ambient fluid are computed using the 
  module `seawater`.


* *Continuous Phase* -- The general term referring to the bulk fluid (e.g.,
  water or air) that is the host for one or more particulate, or dispersed,
  phases (e.g., bubbles, drops, or solid particles).


* *CTD Profile* -- A vertical profile of ambient seawater properties, usually
  containing conductivity (salinity), temperature, depth, and other chemical
  constituents, such as oxygen, fluorescence, etc.


* *Discrete Bubble Model (DBM)* -- The model proposed by McGinnis et al.
  (2006) to account for bubble/droplet-scale processes. One bubble, droplet or
  particle is tracked and all fluxes in and out of the fluid particle are
  evaluated, primarily from correlations in Clift et al. (1978). These fluxes
  are then applied uniformly to all other fluid particles at the same location
  with identical properties that make up the total flux of multiphase
  components. It is possible to have multiple size classes to approximate a
  particle size distribution, but each particle within a given bin of the
  distribution and at the same location will have the same properties.


* *Dispersed Phase* -- The general term referring the fluid particles (e.g.,
  bubbles, drops, or solid particles) dispersed, or spread out, in another
  continuous fluid phase (e.g., water or air).


* *Fluid Particle* -- The general term for a dispersed phase particle of
  liquid or gas; a collective term for bubbles and drops.


* *Intrusion* -- A horizontal layer forming at a level of neutral buoyancy and
  that is squeezed into the layer by buoyancy forces. In certain contexts,
  especially the far field, an intrusion may be referred to as a plume, but
  this usage of the word plume has a different technical meaning than the mean
  of plume in the ``TAMOC`` package; hence, we use the term intrusion
  exclusively for horizontal layers of fluid at neutral buoyancy.


* *Momentum Jet* -- A plume that has significant momentum originating from the
  leak exit conditions.


* *Nearfield* -- The region of a leak plume where vertical momentum is 
  affected by buoyancy.  Typically much less than one kilometer radius from 
  the centerline of a plume.


* *Peng-Robinson Equation of State* -- One of several cubic equations of state
  to account for non-ideal fluid behavior. It was developed particularly with
  the goal of estimating liquid densities from standard chemical and
  thermodynamic properties (e.g., molecular weight, critical point temperature
  and pressure, accentric factor, etc.). The Peng-Robinson equation of state
  provides the *Z*-factor for the compressibility in the ideal gas law to
  estimate the density and the fugacity coefficients to estimate the chemical
  activity, needed to establish solubility.


* *Plume* -- Term referring vertically-rising cloud of dispersed phase
  particles and entrained ambient fluid, similar in appearance to the plume of
  smoke rising from a chimney. Momentum in a plume is dominated by buoyancy
  effects, here caused either by the drag of the dispersed phase particles or
  the negative buoyancy of the entrained ambient seawater.


* *Single Bubble Model (SBM)* -- A numerical model to predict the rise of a
  single fluid particle through quiescent or flowing ambient fluid. This model
  uses the discrete bubble model to predict the fluid particle fate and
  computes the trajectory by the superposition of the rise velocity and the
  ambient currents. In the single bubble model, there is no collective
  buoyancy that induces a vertical velocity of the fluid phase; for that case,
  a plume model is needed (e.g., the stratified plume model).


* *Slip Velocity* -- Taken as the terminal rise velocity of a fluid particle
  in quiescent ambient conditions.  This is used to determine the net drag
  force on the water column due to a collection of fluid particles and to 
  track the movement of fluid particles through the water column.  Turbulence
  is known to alter the quiescent terminal rise velocity; this effect is not
  accounted for in the current ``TAMOC`` methods.


* *Stratified Plume Model (SPM)* -- A numerical model to predict the dynamics
  of a multiphase plume rising in a stagnant stratified ambient fluid. This
  model uses the discrete bubble model to predict the fluid particle fate and
  computes the trajectory by solving the integral plume conservation equations
  for a double plume integral model, as in Socolofsky et al. (2008).


* *Bent Plume Model (BPM)* -- A numerical model to predict the dynamics
  of a multiphase plume rising in a flowing ambient fluid. This
  model uses the discrete bubble model to predict the fluid particle fate and
  computes the trajectory by solving the integral plume conservation equations
  for a Lagrangian plume model, as in Lee and Cheung (1990).
