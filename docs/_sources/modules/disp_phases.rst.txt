.. currentmodule:: dispersed_phases

.. automodule:: dispersed_phases


Class Objects and Methods
=========================

General Particle Object
-----------------------

Several modules in ``TAMOC`` need ``Particle`` objects, and the functionality
of these objects can often be described in a unified way.  The base ``SingleParticle`` object contains this functionality and is described in 
the following:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/disp_phases
   
   SingleParticle
   SingleParticle.properties
   SingleParticle.diameter
   SingleParticle.biodegradation_rate

Plume Particle Object
---------------------

When a ``SingleParticle`` is inside of a plume (e.g., a ``stratified_plume_model`` or ``bent_plume_model``), it needs slightly 
different capabilities.  These are provided as follows in the ``PlumeParticle`` object, which inherits the base object above:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/disp_phases
   
   PlumeParticle
   PlumeParticle.properties
   PlumeParticle.diameter
   PlumeParticle.biodegradation_rate
   PlumeParticle.update


Module Functions
================

This module also contains several utilities to create particle objects and 
to user particle objects to create initial conditions for the various plume
models.  These utilities are listed below:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/disp_phases
   
   initial_conditions
   save_particle_to_nc_file
   load_particle_from_nc_file
   shear_entrainment
   hydrate_formation_time
   zfe_volume_flux
   wuest_ic
   bf_average
   get_chem_names
   particles_state_space
