Unit Tests

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

This package is distributed with a set of unit tests to check most of the 
functionality of the package.  To run the tests, install 
`pytest <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_ into your Python distribution.  Then, 
from a directory within the source files of the distribution, execute at
the command prompt::

    % py.test -v

If any of the tests fail, first delete the ``__pycache__`` directory from the
hard drive and re-run the test.  If that does not solve the problem, please
read the test-specific guidelines below for further potential bug fixes.

test_ambient.py
===============

.. automodule:: test_ambient

Some of the tests using THREDDS connections to ROMS output files have
had problems with opening and closing the files using py.test. If deleting
``__pycache__`` does not solve the problem, the ROMS test can be run from
within IPython using::

    >>> import test_ambient
    >>> test_ambient.test_from_roms()

As long as no messages are echoed to the terminal, the test passed.
