Overview of Bent Plume Model Module

:Date: |today|

.. currentmodule:: bent_plume_model

.. automodule:: bent_plume_model


Class Objects and Methods
=========================

The ``Model`` object is the main interface to the ``bent_plume_model``. Its
definition and methods are as follows:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/bpm
   
   Model
   Model.simulate
   Model.save_sim
   Model.save_txt
   Model.load_sim
   Model.plot_state_space
   Model.plot_all_variables

All of the model parameters are contained in the ``ModelParams`` object. This
object is described in the following:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/bpm
   
   ModelParams

Because bent plume model particles need to be tracked and can leave the
plume, they require extra capabilities compared to particles in the
``dispersed_phases`` module. For this, we define the ``Particle`` object in
the bent plume model module. It has the following definition and methods:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/bpm
   
   Particle
   Particle.properties
   Particle.diameter
   Particle.biodegradation_rate
   Particle.update
   Particle.track
   Particle.outside
   Particle.run_sbm


Local variables defined for each slice of the plume are stored in a
``LagElement`` object. Its definition and methods are as follows:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/bpm
   
   LagElement
   LagElement.update


Module Functions
================

Utility Functions
-----------------

The bent plume model objects defined above use several utilities to perform
their numerical tasks. These are generally not intended to be called directly
by the user and are summarized below:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/bpm
   
   plot_state_space
   plot_all_variables
   width_projection


Numerical Model Functions
-------------------------

The main numerical modeling functions for the bent plume model are stored in
the ``lmp`` module. These functions could be ported to Fortran or another
language, but are not intended for the user to call directly. Instead, these
are used by the objects defined above. The functions contained in the ``lmp``
module are:

.. currentmodule:: lmp

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/bpm
   
   derivs
   calculate
   correct_temperature
   correct_particle_tracking
   entrainment
   track_particles
   local_coords
   main_ic
   bent_plume_ic
   zfe_volume_flux
   flux_to_velocity
