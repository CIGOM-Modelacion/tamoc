Overview of Stratified Plume Model Module

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

.. currentmodule:: stratified_plume_model

.. automodule:: stratified_plume_model


Class Objects and Methods
=========================

The ``Model`` object is the main interface to the ``stratified_plume_model``.
Its definition and methods are as follows:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/spm
   
   Model
   Model.simulate
   Model.save_sim
   Model.save_txt
   Model.load_sim
   Model.plot_state_space
   Model.plot_all_variables

All of the model parameters are contained in the ``ModelParams`` object. This
object is described in the following:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/spm
   
   ModelParams

Local variables defined for each slice of the inner plume are stored in an
``InnerPlume`` object. Its definition and methods are as follows:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/spm
   
   InnerPlume
   InnerPlume.update

Likewise, local variables defined for each slice of the outer plume are
stored in an ``OuterPlume`` object. Its definition and methods are as follows:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/spm
   
   OuterPlume
   OuterPlume.update


Module Functions
================

Utility Functions
-----------------

The stratified plume model objects defined above use several utilities to
perform their numerical tasks. These are generally not intended to be called
directly by the user and are summarized below:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/spm
   
   inner_main
   outer_main
   err_check
   plot_state_space
   plot_all_variables

There are also some functions designed to help create initial conditions for
the model. These are:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/spm
   
   particle_from_Q
   particle_from_mb0


Numerical Model Functions
-------------------------

The main numerical modeling functions for the stratified plume model are
stored in the ``smp`` module. These functions could be ported to Fortran or
another language, but are not intended for the user to call directly.
Instead, these are used by the objects defined above. The functions contained
in the ``smp`` module are:

.. currentmodule:: smp

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../autodoc/spm
   
   derivs_inner
   derivs_outer
   calculate
   correct_temperature
   cp_model
   main_ic
   inner_plume_ic
   outer_surf
   outer_dis
   outer_cpic
   outer_fr
