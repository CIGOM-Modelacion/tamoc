<h1>TAMOC - Texas A&amp;M Oilspill Calculator<a class="headerlink" href="#tamoc-texas-a-m-oilspill-calculator" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>TAMOC is a Python package with Fortran extension modules that provides various
functionality for simulating a subsea oil spill.  This includes methods to
compute equations of state of gas and oil, dissolution, transport of single
bubbles and/or droplets, and simulations of blowout plumes, including the
development of subsurface intrusions, and estimation of initial bubble/droplet
size distributions from source flow conditions.</p>
<p>For typical usage, please see the ./bin directory of the source distribution
for various example scripts.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Version 2.0.0:  Updated the complete model system for compatibility with both</dt><dd><p>Python 2.7 and Python 3.8+.  Updated the ambient.Profile
object so that netCDF files do not have to be created,
including the ability to create a default profile for the
world-ocean average profile.  Create new modules for particle
size distributions and for simulating a blowout, including a
new Blowout object.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.2.1:  Corrected minor errors in translating between NetCDF objects</dt><dd><p>and Numpy arrays to avoid a masked-array error and updated
the dbm_phys.f95 function for the mass transfer rate by Kumar
and Hartland so that the Reynolds number is defined before it
is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.2.0:  Added biodegradation to the fate processes considered in the</dt><dd><p>discrete bubble model (DBM).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.1.1:  Updated the ambient module interpolation method to be</dt><dd><p>compatible with newer versions of numpy, updated a few of
the ./bin examples to only read data provided with TAMOC, and
updated all test cases to be compatible with slight changes
in the dbm module that were done in Version 1.1.0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.1.0:  Updated various modules to be compatible with Anaconda</dt><dd><p>Python, including Scipy version 0.17.0 and higher.  Fixed a
couple bugs in the test cases where output files are not
created correctly.  Updated the documentation with some
missing new variables.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 1.0.0:  Finalized the validation cases and tested the model for</dt><dd><p>release.  This is the first non-beta version of the model,
and is the version for which journal publications have been
prepared.  Most of the changes going forward are expected to
be new capabilities and improvements in the user interface:
the model solutions are not expected to change appreciably.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Beta versions of the model:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Version 0.1.17: Updated the modeling suite so that all of the save/load</dt><dd><p>functions are consistent with the present model variables
and attributes.  Modified the bent plume model so that
ambient currents can come from any direction (three-
dimensional).  Added a new test file for the bent plume
model.  Changed the convergence criteria for the stratified
plume model.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.16: Updated the bent plume model so that post processing is</dt><dd><p>fully consistent with the simulation results.  Also, added
the capability for the bent plume model to stop at the
neutral buoyancy level in the intrusion for a stratified
case.  Updated the equilibrium calculations in the dbm module
so that it does not crash when the first few elements of
the mixture disappear (go to zero) and to speed up the
calculation when successive substitution indicates the
mixture may be single phase, but is slowly converging:
stability analysis is initiated early, which greatly improves
performance for difficult cases.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.15: Moved the particle tracking in the bent plume model inside</dt><dd><p>the main integration loop, which then removes tp and sp
from the model attributes and includes then in the model
state space instead.  Updated the bent plume model state
space so that particle mass is the state variables instead
of particle mass flux and so that the dissovled phase
constituents are modeled as total mass in the Lagrangian
element instead of concentration times mass of the element.
Made a small update to the hydrate formation time equations.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.14: Updated several aspects of the calibration after comparing</dt><dd><p>to available data in Milgram (1983), Jirka (2004), Socolofsky
and Adams (2002, 2003, 2005), Socolofs et al. (2008), and
Socolofsky et al. (2013).  The most significant change is an
updated shear entrainment coefficient for the stratified
plume model.  Also, added a buoyant force reduction as bubbles
drift away from the centerline in a crossflow.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.13: Updated the temperature output for the bent plume model so</dt><dd><p>that the correct temperature is saved when heat transfer ends.
Added the particle time to the state space of the stratified
plume model and added the hydrate formation model of Jun et
al. (2015) to the particle objects in the dispersed phases
module.  The hydrate formation time is set at the start of a
simulation and is properly implemented for all three
simulation modules in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TAMOC</span></code> suite.  To compute the
hydrate formation time using the equations from Jun et al.
(2015), use the function
<cite>dispersed_phases.hydrate_formation_time</cite>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.12: Replaced methods for equilibrium and viscosity with better</dt><dd><p>algorithms.  Fixed small inconsistencies in the dbm.py module
for clean bubbles, and updated the seawater equations of
state with better methods for heat capacity and air/water
surface tension.  Updated values for the Setschenow constant
in ./data/ChemData.csv, and added a mass transfer equation
for Re &lt; 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.11: Replaced some of the -9999 values in the ./data/ChemData.csv</dt><dd><p>file with literature values and updated the units of the
calcualtion of Vb in dbm.py when data are not available.
Also, updated the parameter values for the stratified plume
model with the values recommended in Socolofsky et al. (2008).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.10: Updated the values for Vb in the ./data/ChemData.csv file</dt><dd><p>with their correct values.  Improves computation of
diffusivity and mass transfer over Version 0.1.9, and gives
results similar to Version 0.1.8 and older that used a
different method to estimate diffusivity.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.9<span class="classifier">Made several minor changes to the equations of state per the</span></dt><dd><p>guidance of Jonas Gros.  These changes make the model much
more robust for hydrocarbon mixtures.  The updates are minor
in that the results do not change markedly for the test
cases already in previous versions of the model.  However,
the changes provide major advantages for more difficult
cases, not demonstrated in the simple ./bin examples.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.8<span class="classifier">Added print capability to the params.py module and upgraded</span></dt><dd><p>the shear entrainment model in the bent_plume_model.py
to the entrainment equations in Jirka 2004.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.7<span class="classifier">Added the capability for the bent_plume_model.py to continue</span></dt><dd><p>to track particles outside the plume using the
single_bubble_model.py.  Fixed a bug where particles outside
the plume continued to dissolve and add mass to the
bent_plume_model.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.6<span class="classifier">Added a new simulation module for plumes in crossflow:  the</span></dt><dd><p>bent_plume_model.py.  Refactored some of the code for the
original model suite to make it more general and to reuse it
in the bent_plume_model.  Added example files and unit tests
for the new modules, and updated the documentation to reflect
all model changes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.5<span class="classifier">Fixed a small bug in the way the bubble force is handled</span></dt><dd><p>after the particle dissolves.  Fixed a bug to retain mass
conservation for a bubble size distribution using the
sintef.rosin_rammler() function.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.4<span class="classifier">Added script for the the sintef and params modules to the</span></dt><dd><p>./bin examples directory and the /test unit tests.  Improved
the stability of the model by added a few new checks during
and before calculation.  Updated the unit tests to make them
more platform and numpy-version independent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.3<span class="classifier">Removed some of the debugging catches in the iteration so that</span></dt><dd><p>solutions always fully converge and fixed a few bugs.  See
CHANGES.txt for full details.  Added the sintef.py module for
computing initial bubble/droplet size distributions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.2<span class="classifier">Refined the test suite for compatibility with multiple</span></dt><dd><p>versions of numpy and scipy.  Corrected a few more minor bugs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.1<span class="classifier">Full modeling suite with small bug fixes and complete test</span></dt><dd><p>suite..</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.1.0<span class="classifier">First full modeling suite release, including the stratified</span></dt><dd><p>plume module.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.0.3<span class="classifier">Updated to include the single bubble model and the ambient</span></dt><dd><p>module for handling ambient CTD data.  Includes input and
output using netCDF files and a complete set of tests in
./tamoc/test</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.0.2<span class="classifier">First model release, including the discrete bubble model</span></dt><dd><p>(dmb.py)</p>
</dd>
