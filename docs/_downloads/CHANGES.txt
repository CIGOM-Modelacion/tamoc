v0.1.7, November 17, 2014 --
   . Added capability to track particles outside of the plume during a 
     bent_plume_model simulation using the single_bubble_model
   . Fixed a bug where a particle outside the plume would continue to dissolve
     and add dissolved mass to the plume.
v0.1.6, November 7, 2014 --
   . Added new module bent_plume_model to simulate a single- or multiphase 
     plume in a crossflow.  The single-phase version is based on Lee and 
     Cheung (1990).  The multiphase version updates that model with the 
     multiphase dynamics as implemented in the stratified_plume_model.  The
     dispersed phase is tracked using an analytical function; particles leave
     the plume when they move outside the plume half-width.
   . Added new module dispersed_phases to handle all Particle objects within
     the TAMOC modeling suite.  This moves the single_bubble_model.Particle
     and stratified_plume_model.Particle object into the new module.  Also, 
     moved particle-related helper functions (e.g., particle_from_Q) to the
     new module.  This centralizes all particle dynamics to a single module.
     The new version of the model is fully backward compatible with the 
     original ./bin example files.  Because the unit tests directly access
     module objects and methods that the user would not normally address, 
     the ./test files have been updated slightly to point at the new locations
     of the dispersed_phases objects and functions.
   . Consolidated the save/load functions for particles into the 
     dispersed_phases module.  The save and load methods for the 
     single_bubble_model were poorly done.  These have been upgraded to match
     the methods used in the stratified_plume_model.  As a result, the new
     load_sim function is not compatible with output from the 
     single_bubble_model from previous versions of the TAMOC suite.
   . Added three-dimensional position to the single_bubble_model and the 
     capability for the bubble to be transported by a three-dimensional
     ambient current.  These changes are fully backward-compatible with the
     ./bin examples.  The dimensions of the state space changed, and the 
     appropriate changes had to be included in the ./test unit tests that 
     check individual members of the state space.
   . Renamed the numerical solutions to the stratified_plume_model and the 
     bent_plume_model from simp.py to smp.py and from limp.py to lmp.py.
   . Added a new module model_share.py that contains functionality shared by
     all models and not already available in an appropriate location.  For 
     this release, the model_share module writes the header to the netCDF 
     output files and loads an ambient.Profile object based on information
     read from the netCDF output file.
   . Updated the documentation for the new model structure and included 
     documentation of the full modeling suite.
v0.1.5, March 12, 2014 --
   . Changed the bubble force in the inner plume object for the stratified 
     plume model with bubbles dissolve.  The original code has a weak bubble 
     force with the bubble density is set to the plume density and the bubble
     buoyancy is with respect to the ambient density.  A new if-statement
     replaces "if self.fb[i] == 0." with if the current particle density is
     equal to the local water density, then self.fb and self.xi are both 
     zero.  This is inserted on line 1199.  All test cases still pass.
   . Changed sintef.rosin_rammler() function so that when the size 
     distribution becomes larger than the maximum stable particle size no
     mass is lost by the distribution truncation.  Added else statement on 
     line 334.
v0.1.4, March 12, 2014 --
   . Created the new test cases test_sintef and test_params.
   . Added examples for using the sintef and params modules to the ./bin 
     directories.
   . Updated the documentation with the complete distribution.
   . Modified the simp.outer_cpic() so that if the predicted flux in the outer
     plume is actually upward, the outer plume is not considered to be viable.
     Also, verified that the outer plume is not valid if the volume flux is
     NaN.  Added "or" statements on line 963::
        if dQdz > 0 or Q > 0 or np.isnan(Q):
   . Added a new stop criteria for the simp.calculate() function so that if
     the progress stops, the current integration ends: 
        if z[-1] == z[-2]:
           stop = True
     added to lines 354-355.
   . Modified the way the independent variable is stored in the calculate()
     function of the single_bubble_model.py and simp.py to make it compatible
     with the most recent version of numpy in the Enthough Canopy 
     distribution.
   . Changed the number of required significant figures in the tests for 
     the top of the solution vector in test.spm.py (made it less strict of a
     test). Because of the adaptive step-size solver and the very large 
     integration distances, small changes in the way updated numerical 
     packages work can result in differences in the solution in the third 
     and fourth significant figure.  Rather than update the test solution 
     to match updated numpy/Python packages, the original test solution is
     retained with the two significant figure threshold for passing.
v0.1.3, February 25, 2014 -- 
   . Updated the test cases for test_ambient, test_dbm_object, test_dbm,
     test_sbm, and test_spm to reflect the other changes in this update.
   . Replaced delDiss (the dissolution of species j summed over all particles) 
     on line 144 with a new variable delDiss_p (the dissolution of species j 
     summed over a single particle) in the heat transfer equation for each 
     individual particle.  The old version double-counts heat loss from the  
     particle as a result of dissolution when more than one particle in the 
     solution is dissolving.
   . Changed simp.py line 130ff so that yp[idx] is used (the dissolution of
     species j for particle i) instead of delDiss[j] (the dissolution of
     species j summed over all particles).  The old version double-counts
     heat of solution when more than one particle in the solution is 
     dissolving.
   . Added temperature as an output from the sbm.particle.update method so 
     that temperature is consistently handled throughout the simulation.
   . Updated the ambient.extend_profile_deeper method so that the correct
     pressure is computed for the extended region of the profile.
   . Fixed a bug in the Fortran files so that the Peng-Robinson equation of 
     state module can always find the correct, non-negative minimum and 
     maximum roots.  Previously, the minimum root was assumed to be less than
     1.0, which caused spurious behavior at extreme conditions.
   . Fixed a bug in simp.py to make sure the temperature is always modeled 
     correctly.
   . Added the Rosin-Rammler distribution to the SINTEF module.
   . Added hydrate dissolution reduction factor as a function of hydrate 
     stability for the mass transfer method of the FluidParticle object in 
     dbm.py.
   . Added a hydrate stability zone calculation to the FluidMixture object
     in dbm.py.
   . Updated model save functions so that when variables are defined as None
     their assumed values are saved.
   . Removed stop criteria based on the maximum number of calculation steps 
     in both the single bubble model and stratified plume model so that the 
     models always runs to completion.  This means if an error occurs, they
     may get stuck in a loop trying to get past a numerical obstacle, but the
     alternative is that the model stops for the wrong reasons.  This was
     previously part of the model to aid during development.  
   . Added new module sintef.py to compute the initial bubble and droplet 
     size distribution using the SINTEF model.
v0.1.2, September 19, 2013 --
   . Moved octant import to the functions that require it.  
   . Added `from copy import copy` to `single_bubble_model.py`
   . Added test for insoluble particles to ./test/test_sbm.py
   . Changed tests for ./test/test_spm.py to avoid instability in outer plume 
     initial conditions and to reduce the number of iterations for the full 
     plume simulations.  This was required since different versions of numpy
     and scipy were getter slightly different results after multiple 
     iterations:  not for the overall solution, but very small errors in 
     heights lead to measureable differences in output at identical heights.
     This is a result of the adaptive time step stiff solver and iteration.
v0.1.1, September 11, 2013 -- 
   . Updated the `spm_test.py` file with a complete test suite.
   . Added a plotting method for the complete suite of model variables in the
     Stratified Plume Model.
   . Updated the documentation with a few missing functions.
   . Includes the following bug fixes:
      . Fixed plotting methods in the single bubble model and stratified plume
        model when an inert particle (which has one component) clashed with 
        the modeled dissolved concentrations (which has zero components).
      . Set the temperature of the fluid surrounding a particle in the inner 
        plume equal to the temperature of the inner plume (once heat transfer
        is complete).  Previously, this was set equal to the ambient 
        temperature.
      . Changed the temperature correction in the `simp` module to reflect
        the temperature of the inner plume instead of the ambient temperature
        when heat transfer is complete.
v0.1.0, August 20, 2013 -- 
   Initial release including the stratified plume model.  Also includes:
      . Fixed pressure correction for Henry's coefficients to be based on 
        the total pressure at depth instead of the partial pressure of each
        species.
      . Changed the `ambient.Profile` object so that it removes any 
        unstable parts of the density profile.  
      . Small changes to the single bubble model so that both the single
        bubble model and the stratified plume model have parallel 
        programming architecture and behavior.  
v0.0.3, July 31, 2013 -- 
   Initial release including the ambient module and single bubble model
v0.0.2, July 8, 2013 -- 
   Initial release including the discrete bubble model
