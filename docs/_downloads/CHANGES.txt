v0.1.2, September 19, 2013 --
   . Moved octant import to the functions that require it.  
   . Added `from copy import copy` to `single_bubble_model.py`
   . Added test for insoluble particles to ./test/test_sbm.py
   . Changed tests for ./test/test_spm.py to avoid instability in outer plume 
     initial conditions and to reduce the number of iterations for the full 
     plume simulations.  This was required since different versions of numpy
     and scipy were getter slightly different results after multiple 
     iterations:  not for the overall solution, but very small errors in 
     heights lead to measureable differences in output at identical heights.
     This is a result of the adaptive time step stiff solver and iteration.
v0.1.1, September 11, 2013 -- 
   . Updated the `spm_test.py` file with a complete test suite.
   . Added a plotting method for the complete suite of model variables in the
     Stratified Plume Model.
   . Updated the documentation with a few missing functions.
   . Includes the following bug fixes:
      . Fixed plotting methods in the single bubble model and stratified plume
        model when an inert particle (which has one component) clashed with 
        the modeled dissolved concentrations (which has zero components).
      . Set the temperature of the fluid surrounding a particle in the inner 
        plume equal to the temperature of the inner plume (once heat transfer
        is complete).  Previously, this was set equal to the ambient 
        temperature.
      . Changed the temperature correction in the `simp` module to reflect
        the temperature of the inner plume instead of the ambient temperature
        when heat transfer is complete.
v0.1.0, August 20, 2013 -- 
   Initial release including the stratified plume model.  Also includes:
      . Fixed pressure correction for Henry's coefficients to be based on 
        the total pressure at depth instead of the partial pressure of each
        species.
      . Changed the `ambient.Profile` object so that it removes any 
        unstable parts of the density profile.  
      . Small changes to the single bubble model so that both the single
        bubble model and the stratified plume model have parallel 
        programming architecture and behavior.
